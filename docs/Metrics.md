The OpenTelemetry Metrics API supports capturing measurements about the execution of a computer program at run time. The Metrics API is designed explicitly for processing raw measurements, generally with the intent to produce continuous summaries of those measurements, giving developers visibility into their serviceâ€™s operational metrics.
